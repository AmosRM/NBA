NBA data project

My NBA data analytics project, data generated using NBA_API.

  - Shot chart per team per season (using JPHwang's structure)
  - The efficiency landscape graph (Kirk Goldsberry twitter)
  - YouTube - JxmyHighroller. create same data.


build a function to get the data i need, put it in a py file and create viz for it.
KenJee also has many great ideas on his YT channel.

the shotchart.py should be much more clear, make a seperate file for the court drawing 
and call it in the main file instead of the main file being so long.

the data i used from JPHwang, create a data extraction by my self to fetch it.

write down what i need for the efficiency lanscape graph.
