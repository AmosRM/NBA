NBA data project

My NBA data analytics project, data generated using NBA_API.

  - Shot chart per team per season (using JPHwang's structure)
  - The efficiency landscape graph (Kirk Goldsberry twitter)
  - YouTube - JxmyHighroller. create same data.


build a function to get the data i need, put it in a py file and create viz for it.
KenJee also has many great ideas on his YT channel.
